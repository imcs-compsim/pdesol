A small collection of closed-form solutions to PDE-based initial boundary value problems

### Example
With the product of sine waves, closed-form solutions for the homogeneous heat equation, advection-diffusion equation, and homogeneous wave equation in 1D, 2D, and 3D are constructed. These are useful to benchmark numerical solvers like FEM.
